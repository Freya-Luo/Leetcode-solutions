**Solution**
- Mono Stack
  - Intuition
    - key variant: always keep the stack monotonic property **before inserting** a new element
    - if pop **smaller** before pushing, the stack is **decreasing** (keep larger ones in the stack)
    - if pop **larger** before pushing, the stack is **increasing**
  - here, find "next" smaller ones boundary
    - need to pop "smaller" ones, so <u>decreasing</u> mono stack
    - why NOT reverse?
      - if `new price` is smaller than `top()`, we cannot ensure it is useless in the future;
      - however, if is larger, then we can ensure it is useless `(as already set an boundary)`
    - keep the record of the **previous found value** by introducing 2nd element

- WHEN to use `Mono Stack`?
  - when finding `Next Largest/Smallest` element
  - when finding `Max/Min in a Sliding Window`
